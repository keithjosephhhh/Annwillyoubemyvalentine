        text: `You make life so much easier and my days infinitely brighter,
        I can‚Äôt help but remember those evenings when we used to kiss and hug tighter
        And I felt like time should‚Äôve stood still, freezing everyone except us.
        I miss every second of those moments with you, because the distance between us feels unbearable sometimes.

        Whenever I close my eyes, I see you exactly like when I used to wrap my hands around your waist, almost about to hug you.
        It‚Äôs those memories that give me comfort, knowing you‚Äôre waiting for me, just as I am waiting for you.
        I can‚Äôt wait for the day I‚Äôll hold you close again, feel your warmth, and keep you near my heart where you belong my baby.

        You‚Äôve made my life simpler, my days lighter, but you‚Äôve made my nights tougher.
        Because while the world thinks I‚Äôm asleep, I‚Äôm wide awake dreaming about you.
        Molly, You‚Äôre everything I ever prayed for in a girl, You are the answer to my deepest prayers.

        I love you, baby.`

        I don‚Äôt mean pretty like the girls in the magazine,
        I mean pretty, like the rising sun's golden sheen.
        Like Christmas mornings, wrapped in joy's embrace,
        Pretty like a child‚Äôs first gaze. 
        
        When I say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty‚Äù. 
        I don‚Äôt imagine pretty like the perfect face of a human,
        I imagine pretty, like the tip of the nose turn red under the winter sun. 
        Like an old handwritten note found after years being lost. 
        Pretty like the warmth of the smile that could melt away the frost
        
        When I say "You're pretty."
        I don‚Äôt picture perfect; I see beauty that captures the soul,
        Like the embrace of a hug that makes the universe fade and love takes control.`

        ‚ÄòA thing of beauty‚Äô, he‚Äôd quote. 
        For the rays of sun reflect off your skin like a glow of dawn at the horizon, 
        Where my dream begins. 
        
        You look like Lord Byron would write a poem for you ‚Äî
        ‚ÄòShe walks in beauty‚Äô, he‚Äôd quote. 
        For your face is like a canvas of night, adorned with stars reflecting the sunlight,
        Where my heart takes flight. 
        
        You look like Alfred Lord Tennyson would write a poem for you ‚Äî
        ‚ÄúThe princess‚Äù, he‚Äôd quote. 
        For your strength and grace are like moonlight‚Äôs embrace 
        Where my mind feels it truly belongs.

        Your eyes tell a story I wanna get lost in. 
        Those pretty organs of sight intoxicate me every time I look in them. 
        
        That smile of yours can even cure cancer, what am I in front of it.

        Our love is strong, it bends the seas

        Because now, even the moon is jealous of you
        
        You deserve a world, where your dreams take flight 
        With me as your shadow, your king, and your knight
        
        Molly you deserve whispers in a cold night‚Äôs air
        Those will be my soft words of love beyond compare 
        
        You deserve moments of love, that will never fade. 
        For my heart will always be for you, unafraid 
        
        Above all of this baby, you deserve me. If fate allows
        To love you deeply today, tomorrow and forever now `
